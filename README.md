# ephemeral
a three.js world
# [Demo](http://nfosterky.github.io/ephemeral/)

A Kalman filter is used to smooth accelerometer data and predict the velocity of the device.

There is a camera viewing a threejs scene. When the velocity data greater or less than a certain threshold the movement is used to move the camera through the threejs scene.
